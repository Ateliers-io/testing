# Testing Repository

This repository contains black-box integration, regression, performance,
and security tests executed against deployed services.

- No application source code is stored here
- Tests interact only via URLs, APIs, and deployed artifacts
- Integration is performed at deployment time via CI/CD

This repository is intentionally decoupled from frontend and backend
repositories to ensure realistic system-level validation.
